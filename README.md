# movie-recommendation-system
This project implements a Movie Recommendation System using cosine similarity to provide personalized movie suggestions. By analyzing movie attributes and user preferences, the system effectively identifies and recommends films that match individual tastes, enhancing the user experience in discovering new movies.
The system can be evaluated based on user satisfaction and the accuracy of the recommendations. Feedback can be collected to refine the recommendation algorithm further.
